## Project Description
A gratitude journal/ mood tracker. The goal is to write down at least one thing you are grateful for a day and hopefully this will boost your mood over time. 

## Side Note
I want to make a big push for a front end design I find beautiful. I have not been able to acheive a look on my apps that I've been 100%v happy with.

## Additional Libraries
- React Bootstrap https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
- Still researching an extra library to use for something we didnt learn in class. 

## Issues
- I could not figure out an issue with sibmitting my form. I spent 6 hours on zoom calls with the TA and other students. 
- Deploying backend took me a total of 7 hrs and the front end I worked on for 3 hrs on the frontend.
- I have never had as many issues as I did with this project. It gave me patience but also taught me about debugging when it comes to django and python. Overall I am proud of the finishes look, the work I put in and all the things I have accomplished in this course.
